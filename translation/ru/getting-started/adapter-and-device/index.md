Adapter and Device
==================

The **device** is the **main object** we interact with when using WebGPU. It is the object from which we can **create** all other ones (textures, buffers, pipelines, etc.), **send instructions** to the GPU, and **handle errors**.

The next two chapters describes the **device initialization process**, which is where we also **check the capabilities** of the end user's physical device.
